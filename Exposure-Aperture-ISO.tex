\chapter{Exposure, Aperture, ISO - the Science behind Photography}
\label{chap:Aperture-Exposure-ISO}

Having already introduced \glspl{stop} as a way of describing the relationship between light intensity, it is now time to put this to good use. This chapter is a ``must read'' in the whole guide, as it will introduce you to the three most important concepts of digital or also analog photography, namely \gls{exposure}, \gls{aperture} and \gls{ISO}.
\\
This chapter will again require some mathematics, but only simple operations. To start off, a little bit of terminology. When stating ``by a factor'', this refers to either a multiplication or division. Hence By a factor of two means divide by two or multiply by two.

\section{Conclusion - Exposure, Aperture, ISO}

Having finished this chapter, you have completed the basic introduction to the key settings of a digital \gls{SLR} camera. You can now head out and experiment a bit, or alternatively, read on.
