# photoguide

Back in 2011 I set out to write a little basic book on photography which was the result of a discussion about the use of LaTeX in the preparation of documents. This document sat as a (neglected) compiled pdf on detlevcm.wordpress.com

Now I have decided to make the source available so that it mauy potentially become more useful for other people.

It is not envisaged that I will continue to develop the text, however I am not excluding the possibility.
For now the photos will not be included in this repository with only the actual LaTeX text source available.
